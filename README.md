# Baltimore Inclusive Growth Score (IGS) Analysis  

This ongoing project examines patterns of economic and social inclusion across Baltimore City using Mastercard’s **Inclusive Growth Score (IGS)** data at the census tract level (2022–2024).  
It serves as a working research environment supporting my broader findings and written analysis on inclusive growth, public investment, and neighborhood transformation in Baltimore.

## 🧭 Purpose  

The goal is to understand how inclusive growth varies across Baltimore’s neighborhoods — identifying which census tracts are improving, which are lagging, and what systemic factors may explain those trends.  

This repository will expand over time as additional, more granular data sources are added (e.g., demographic, housing, and investment datasets).
